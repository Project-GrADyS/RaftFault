## Overview

### Purpose
RaftFault is a fault-tolerant Raft consensus implementation **primarily developed to be used in conjunction with the GradySim simulation framework**. The system is based on the Raft consensus algorithm as defined in the seminal paper by **Ongaro and Ousterhout (2014) "In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm"**. While designed specifically for GradySim integration, the system's adapter-based architecture allows it to be used with other Python based simulation frameworks and distributed systems.

**Enhancement to Standard Raft:** The system introduces an improvement to the original Raft algorithm through its **Fault-Tolerant mode**, which includes active node discovery before elections. This enhancement addresses a limitation of the standard Raft algorithm described in the Ongaro paper, enabling the system to recover from massive node failures by dynamically adapting majority calculations based on discovered active nodes rather than using a fixed cluster size; it is a useful feature for UAV swarm control.

**Other differences from Standard Raft:** Unlike the Raft algorithm described in the Ongaro paper, this implementation does **not include log replication**. While the original Raft typically handles a single consensus value at a time, this implementation allows the leader to define and manage **multiple consensus variables simultaneously**, enabling more information applied to distributed coordination scenarios.

### Scope
The system provides:
- **Distributed consensus** on values (not log entries)
- **Leader election** with automatic failover
- **Active node discovery** for dynamic cluster adaptation
- **Massive failure recovery** capabilities
